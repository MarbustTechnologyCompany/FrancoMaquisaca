## About

**FRANCO MAQUISACA**  
MENTOR IN EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT  
Founder and leader of ELEMENTARY, a global Business and Innovation Consulting firm.

Since the age of 16, I have ventured into the business world, developing skills that have led me to own multiple ventures and businesses. However, despite achieving professional goals, accumulating wealth, and enjoying travel, I experienced an emotional void. I identified that the reason lay in not having healed or consciously examined my life story.

Today, I lead my company from an emotionally balanced space, which allows me to fully enjoy my work and lead a life full of satisfaction and well-being.

Currently, I offer mentorships focused on mindset change and neural reprogramming using hypnosis as a tool in Neuroplasticity. My goal is to guide others towards a purposeful life and help them develop conscious personal and business projects.

I am here to accompany you in your growth process in a conscious and healthy way.

Everything starts and ends in the mind...
